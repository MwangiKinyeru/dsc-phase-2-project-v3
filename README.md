## Conclusion and Recommndations
 1. Voice of Kenya should focus more on production of mystery genre movie. They should also venture 
in producing adventure, action, comedy, horror, and thriller films. These genres offer a balance of 
manageable profitability.

2. They should consider cost of production - This is a key aspect. For example producing the western 
genre is very costly yet it is not profitable at all. In our data it shows that the cost of production of 
the thriller is not very high but it gives the best profit Based on the analysis of production costs per 
genre. Producing Horror, Comedy, and Thriller films, which offer a good balance of moderate 
production costs and high profitability.

3. The strong positive linear relationship between Domestic Gross and Worldwide Gross suggests that 
movies performing well domestically tend to also perform well internationally. Invest in genres and 
film types that have historically performed well domestically
